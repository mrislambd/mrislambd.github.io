## About
<p style="text-align: justify">   
    Hi, thank you and welcome to my website. My name is Mohammad Rafiqul Islam (Rafiq Islam), and I am
    a Ph.D. candidate in the Mathematics Department at Florida State University. My research focuses on *Theoretical Machine Learning*, particularly optimization and sampling techniques in Bayesian learning using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. I work on developing scalable algorithms for collaborative learning under regularization and privacy constraints. My research is conducted under the supervision of professor <a href="https://www.math.fsu.edu/DepartmentNews/Articles/Fac_Zhu.math" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"> Lingjiong Zhu</a>.<br>
    <br>
    I hold a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Mathematics degree from the <a href="https://www.du.ac.bd" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank"> University of Dhaka, Bangladesh</a>, with minors in Statistics, Physics, and Computer Science. I also completed an integrated master's degree in Applied Mathematics from the same institution. During my master's studies, I pursued actuarial exams and passed several professional exams from the <a href="https://www.ifoa.org.uk" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA), UK </a> which are equivalent to the exams P, FM, and Life Contingencies of <a href="https://www.soa.org" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"> Society of Actuaries (SOA), USA </a>. With this background, I began my professional career in the life insurance industries in Bangladesh, working for two years at two prominent life insurance companies.<br>
    <br>
    In 2018, I moved to the United States to pursue a second masterâ€™s degree in Mathematics, specializing in Statistics and Data Analytics, at Youngstown State University, Ohio. During my studies and professional work, I developed a deeper interest in data science, machine learning, and research, which ultimately led me to pursue a Ph.D. in Mathematics with a focus on Theoretical Machine Learning.
