    I am currently a Ph.D. candidate and a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) in the Mathematics Department at Florida State University. I am actively involved in research in the area of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Financial Mathematics under the supervision of professor <a href="https://www.math.fsu.edu/DepartmentNews/Articles/Fac_Zhu.math" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"> Lingjiong Zhu</a>.<br>
    <br>
     My academic journey has been both diverse and enriching, spanning multiple institutions and fields of study. Before joining FSU, I obtained a master’s degree in Mathematics from Youngstown State University in Ohio, USA. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at the University of Dhaka (DU), Bangladesh, followed by a one-year integrated master’s program in Applied Mathematics at the same institution.
