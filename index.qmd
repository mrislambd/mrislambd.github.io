Welcome to my website! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Mathematics Department at Florida State University, where I also serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant. My academic journey has been both diverse and enriching, spanning multiple institutions and fields of study. <br>
<br>
Before joining FSU, I earned a second master’s degree in Mathematics from Youngstown State University in Ohio, USA. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at the University of Dhaka (DU), Bangladesh, followed by a one-year integrated master’s program in Applied Mathematics at the same institution.<br>
<br>
After graduating from DU, I gained valuable industry experience by working for two years in the life insurance sector in Dhaka, Bangladesh. In pursuit of higher education and advanced research opportunities, I relocated to the United States in August 2018.<br>
<br>
As a lifelong student and researcher of mathematics, my research interests are centered around Theoretical Machine Learning, Computational Finance, and various other areas of applied mathematics. I am passionate about advancing knowledge in these fields and contributing to their practical applications.
