Students who have substantial knowledge of precalculus and algebra may require to take this course as a mathematics requirement depending on their majors. The topic of this course includes but is not limited to Foundation for calculus: Functions and Limits, Derivative, The Definite Integral, and Constructing Antiderivatives.<br>
<br>
As a recitation instructor for this course, I ran two poster presentation sessions of 30 students in each group where they presented mathematical problems and their solutions step by step to their peer classmates followed by a group activity where they solved another set of problems. I also graded their exam scripts and weekly posters.
