## Project Overview  

<p style="text-align: justify">
    This predictive modeling project involves personal medical data to predict the medical insurance charge by using a linear regression model.
</p>

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance){target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"}  

**Columns**

`age`: age of primary beneficiary

`sex`: insurance contractor gender, female, male

`bmi`: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight $\frac{kg}{m^ 2}$ using the ratio of height to weight, ideally $18.5$ to $24.9$

`children`: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

`smoker`: Smoking

`region`: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

`charges`: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Stakeholders  

Can we accurately predict insurance costs?

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  

<p style="text-align: justify">
All the features were considered for the modeling purposes. However, from the exploratory data analysis and mathematical analysis, it was found that the `charges` usually goes up for the factors such as increase in `age`, living in certain `region`, having certain number of `children`. But this is not always the same depending on the `smoker` variable. Also, there is a strong correlation between `age` and `bmi` variable. Age a result new features such as `age_bmi` and `age_bmi_smoker` features were created to see how the `charges` interact.
</p>

## Modeling  
### Modeling Approaches  

We consider the following models  

1. **Baseline model:** Assumption that the `charges` variable can be modeled with the mean value of this `charges` variable.  
   $$ 
   \text{charges}=\mathbb{E}[\text{charges}]+\xi
   $$
2. **Linear Regression with `age-bmi-smoke` interaction**  
   $$
    \text{charges}=\beta_0+\beta_1 (\text{age\_bmi})+\beta_2 (\text{male})+\beta_3 (\text{smoke})+\beta_4 (\text{children})+\beta_5 (\text{region})+\beta_6 (\text{age-bmi-smoke})+\xi
   $$  

3. **K-Neighbor Regression**  
   $k$NN using all the original feature with $k=10$

### Final Model  

Finally the modeling was done based on the lowest `MSE` value found from the 5-fold cross validation and the model has the following form  

\begin{align*}
\text{charges} &=10621.25+ 3346.14\times \text{Age\_BMI}+4570.76\times \text{Male}+ 479.61\times \text{Smoke}-315.12\times \text{Children}\\
&+13274.48\times \text{Region}-212.22\times \text{Age\_BMI\_Smoke}
\end{align*}


## Results and Outcomes  

### Model Accuracy  
The model above returns an RMSE of $5853.0$ on the training set and an RMSE of $5600.0$
on the test set with an $R^2=80\%$.  

### Web Application  

The final model was developed and deployed using `Streamlit`. To try a single instance, fill out the following form and then click predict charges.

## Future Directions  

Future project on the same data could be adding a neural network and compare the relative performances of the two models.
