Automatic Symptom Detection (ASD) and Automatic Diagnosis (AD) have seen several advances in recent years. Patients and medical professionals would benefit from tools that can aid in diagnosing diseases based on antecedents and presenting symptoms. The lack of quality healthcare in many parts of the world makes solving this problem a matter of utmost urgency. The aim of this project is to build a tool that can diagnose a disease based on a list of symptoms and contribute to our understanding of automatic diagnosis.
