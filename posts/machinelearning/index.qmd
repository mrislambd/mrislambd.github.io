    This blog post is my personal repository of most common and useful machine learning algorithms using Python. In summer 2024, I participated in a [Data Science Boot Camp by the Erdos Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/){target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"}. Therefore, the topics listed here mostly align with their bootcamp syllabus. Note that, I did not copy their materials directly that affects the copyright issues. I wrote evrything in my own words and used new dataset.
