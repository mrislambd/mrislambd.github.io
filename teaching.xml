<p>One of the course objectives is for each student to develop a mastery of financial mathematics used by actuaries, based on the mathematics of interest theory. Other course objectives are for each student to understand the long-term individual study commitment necessary to achieve a designation within one of the actuarial societies and for each student to increase their knowledge of the actuarial profession</p>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>PreCalculus and Algebra are one of the many important foundation math courses that open doors to many upper-level math and science courses. The topic of this course includes but not is limited to Complex Numbers, Piecewise Functions, Quadratic Functions, Polynomial Functions, Polynomial Division, Zeros of Polynomials, Rational Functions, Polynomial and Rational Inequalities, Inverse Functions, Exponential Functions, Logarithmic Functions, Properties of Logarithms, Exponential and Logarithmic Equations, and so on.<br> <br> As an Instructor of Record for this course, I taught a class of 27 undergraduate students from different majors. I also proctor their lab classes where they take their quizzes and tests online and other application based lab activities.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>Students who have substantial knowledge of precalculus and algebra may require to take this course as a mathematics requirement depending on their majors. The topic of this course includes but is not limited to Foundation for calculus: Functions and Limits, Derivative, The Definite Integral, and Constructing Antiderivatives.<br> <br> As a recitation instructor for this course, I ran two poster presentation sessions of 30 students in each group where they presented mathematical problems and their solutions step by step to their peer classmates followed by a group activity where they solved another set of problems. I also graded their exam scripts and weekly posters.</p>
